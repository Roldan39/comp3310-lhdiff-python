# LHDiff: Language-Independent Line Tracking Tool
**COMP-3110 Project | Python Implementation v2.1**

## 📖 Overview
LHDiff is a tool designed to track lines of source code between two versions of a file. [cite_start]Unlike standard `diff` utilities that only detect insertions and deletions, LHDiff uses **Context** and **Content** similarity to identify lines that have moved, been modified, split, or merged[cite: 3, 135].

[cite_start]This implementation solves the "Line Mapping Problem" by using a hybrid approach involving Levenshtein Distance (Content) and Cosine Similarity (Context)[cite: 285, 286].

## 🚀 Features
* **Language Independent:** Works on Java, Python, C++, and text files.
* **Two-Pass Matching Algorithm:** Uses a "Hawk and Mouse" strategy to lock in high-confidence matches before attempting to match ambiguous lines.
* **Bi-Directional Mapping:**
    * [cite_start]**Split Detection:** Detects when one line splits into two (e.g., breaking long arguments)[cite: 357].
    * **Merge Detection:** Detects when multiple lines combine into one (e.g., code cleanup).
* **Automated Evaluation:** Includes a test harness to verify accuracy against a Ground Truth dataset.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* No external `pip` packages required (uses standard libraries: `difflib`, `math`, `re`, `argparse`).
